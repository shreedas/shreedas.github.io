<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. I joined UT Austin in Fall 2007 after completing my B.Tech in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. 
I was the recipient of the B.C.Roy Memorial Gold Medal for being the best allrounder in IIT Kharagpur, 2007, and was supported by the Microelectronics and Computer Development Fellowship, UT Austin, 2007-2009.</p>
